# dog-breed_classifier

dog-breed_classifier is a classifier that uses CNN(Concolutional Neural Network) plus transfer learning to do dog breed classification. When a human figure is detected, the classifier will output the most similar breed of dog to that person. If neither human nor dog is detected, the classifier will output 'An error in detection has just happened! '
